## 🏁 Getting Started

Ready to take CRUDMaster for a spin? Follow these steps to launch your own instance:

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+ (The fuel for Spring Boot)
- Maven (For dependency magic)
- MySQL (Your data kingdom)
- IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended, but any IDE will do)
- Postman (For API adventures)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtharvaKakade/CRUDMaster.git
   cd CRUDMaster
   ```

2. **Set Up MySQL**  
   - Create a database named `crudmaster_db` (or tweak `application.properties` to your liking).
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/crudmaster_db
     spring.datasource.username=your-username
     spring.datasource.password=your-password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```

3. **Build & Run**  
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Your app will roar to life at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Test with Postman**  
   Fire up Postman and hit the endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/items`, `POST /api/items`)—watch CRUDMaster flex its muscles!

## 🎮 Usage

Here’s a sneak peek at what you can do:

- **Create**: `POST /api/students` - Add a new item with validated swagger.
- **Read**: `GET /api/students` - Fetch all items or `GET /api/items/{id}` for a specific one.
- **Update**: `PUT /api/students/{id}` - Tweak an item with precision.
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/students/{id}` - Say goodbye to unwanted data.

**Pro Tip**: Check the custom validations in action—try sneaking in bad data and watch CRUDMaster hold the line!
